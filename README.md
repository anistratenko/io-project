### Contribution guidelines ###

Developing process is performed in 6 steps
1. **Idea** - Once week we talk about our ideas, and how to implement them ( meeting usually takes around an hour)
2. After meeting one person is designated to **fill tasks in TODO** sections on repository board. From that moment every one who want, can reserve task ( pull card to section IN PROGRES and sign it)
3. Every task is developed on **separate branch** 
4. When you finish writing your feature, you make **pull request** to branch `Testing`, move your card to `done` section, and create new card in `TODO` for testers (They may not see your code, because of pull request, but they will get it eventually)
5. It may be necessary to **tweak your code** to fit the overall programing style of the project, so in that case, just implement suggested changes on your branch
6. When testing fail, issue will be created, and **process will start over** ( you don't need to feel obliged to work on issue of your function, it's a new task )
